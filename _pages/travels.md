Traveling by car means freedom and independence. There is no need to have a specific destination, and it is enough to enjoy the route itself to have unforgettable adventures. 

Together with friends, I took part in two editions of the Zlombol charity rally in 2022 to Albania and 2023 to Portugal.

I took part in language courses in the United States and the United Kingdom.
