My first words that I uttered were "rura wydechowa" which means exhaust pipe. From there, the further development of automotive passion and mechanics was inevitable.   

In the past, my colleagues and I repaired and modified cars together. In one project, we added a turbocharger to a naturally aspirated engine and tuned the car ourselves, doubling the vehicle's original power output. 

I like to tinker and know why something works. Using a 3d printer, I used to created mini-projects.
