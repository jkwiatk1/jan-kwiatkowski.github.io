I have been training in sports since I was young. <br> In the beginning it was judo and soccer. After a few years, I switched this to cycling, in which I had a lot of success. Cycling is an amazing sport, which first of all teaches discipline but also courage and teamwork. <br>
Unfortunately, when I started university, I had to stop doing this sport to focus on my studies. Since then I have been trying other sports like gym, swimming, snowboarding, etc.
